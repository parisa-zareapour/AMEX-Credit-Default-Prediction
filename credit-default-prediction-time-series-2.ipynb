Introduction\n\nCredit default prediction is central to managing risk in a consumer lending business. Credit default prediction allows lenders to optimize lending decisions, which leads to a better customer experience and sound business economics. Current models exist to help manage risk. But it's possible to create better models that can outperform those currently in use.\n\nIn this notebook, I will apply my machine learning skills to predict credit default. Specifically, I will leverage the Kaggle's \"American Express - Default Prediction\" Competition data set to build a machine learning model. Training, validation, and testing datasets include time-series behavioral data and anonymized customer profile information.\n\n\nThe objective is to predict the probability that a customer does not pay back their credit card balance amount in the future based on their monthly customer profile. The target binary variable is calculated by observing 18 months performance window after the latest credit card statement, and if the customer does not pay due amount in 120 days after their latest statement date it is considered a default event.\n\n\nThe dataset contains aggregated profile features for each customer at each statement date. Features are anonymized and normalized, and fall into the following general categories:\n\nD_* = Delinquency variables\nS_* = Spend variables\nP_* = Payment variables\nB_* = Balance variables\nR_* = Risk variables\nwith the following features being categorical:\n\n['B_30', 'B_38', 'D_114', 'D_116', 'D_117', 'D_120', 'D_126', 'D_63', 'D_64', 'D_66', 'D_68']\n\n\nMy purpose in this notebook is to explore and model the time series component of the data.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 2.
